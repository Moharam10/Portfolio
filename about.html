        <p class="about-me__description">I’m a Mechatronics Engineer and an entry-level Web Developer who enjoys solving puzzles, seeking new challenges, setting new goals and going after them. I also enjoy discovering new things, new places, and new fields of science. I have a curious mind that wants to learn everything about everything. I’m also an independent and self-learner who is continually evaluating and upgrading his skills and I always invest all time and effort needed to learn a new skill as long as things keep getting more interesting and this’s exactly what I’ve been doing in the past a few months in the Web Development field learning new programming languages and tools that will aid me in my career.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me__description">
          For a long time I have wanted to learn the ins and outs of this industry. I believe it’s the most successful industry right now, and, more importantly, the most expandable industry in the future, especially with new technologies emerging every day. I’m confidence, within 15 years, and when Augmented Reality and the Internet of Things are fully supported, this industry will reach unbelievable levels of creativity. My goal is to be involved in this industry and then to be part of it in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="about-me__description">
          I also hold keen interest in all hot topics in science, especially Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Actually, I feel my academic background as a mechatronics engineer and my lifelong experience with a wide range of programming language has served me a lot to achieve my current goal and to acquire all the needed skills for a successful Wed Developer in the least amount of time. Now I’m registered as a master student at Paderborn University in Germany. Therefore I can work part-time for an exciting company that wants to attract new talents.
